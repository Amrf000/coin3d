WHAT'S THIS?
============

Beyond Coin: Gold (v1.0, the Open Inventor compatibility release), we intend
to extend the original Open Inventor API where we think it lacks needed
functionality.  This file contains a collection of such API extension ideas
that we will consider to implement in the future.

The listing of an API change or API extension in this file does not mean that
it will be implemented, only that it will be considered to be implemented.

Ideas for this wish list can be submitted by anyone.


THE WISH LIST

  It would be preferable to have methods for getting the valid enum names
  (add more introspection), so you can connect generic GUI selection boxes to
  enum fields without having to know the node/field combination intimately.

  Proposition:
    public:
  +   int getNumEnums(void);
  +   int getEnum( int idx, SbName & name ); // returns enum value
