This document contains a list of ideas for interns' or student's
projects:

* A "gl-attack" application stressing many different aspects of
  OpenGL-drivers to try to make them crash or exhibit bugs.

* A good viewer GUI framework.

* Java-binding to the Coin API. See the misc-resources.txt file.

* Python-binding. See the misc-resources.txt file.

* Work with the documentation to improve it (add example code
  snippets, screenshots, elaborate on the important parts, ...).

* Write many more examples, covering the functionality offered by
  Coin.

* Write a tutorial.

* Implement fontloaders for various platforms and font format types to
  improve the SoText3 and SoText2 nodes.  FreeType library support would
  be great.

* Write a NURBS-library covering all the necessary functionality we
  need within the nurbs-based node classes. A good starting point
  would probably be the newly released OpenGL library from SGI (which
  contains a separate libnurbs module, it seems).  Avoiding using GLU
  could solve a lot of problems.
  
* An IVF (MFC-based) GUI-glue library.

* Make simple routines for packaging up Coin for RedHat Linux (.rpm),
  Suse Linux (.rpm), Debian (.deb), HP-UX (depot), SGI IRIX
  (something), etc.  Check out the Samba distribution, there are lots
  of templates to look at.

* Do the work needed for being compatible with 64-bit systems.

* Implement heuristics for doing rendercaching.

* Profiling and optimalization of rendering and other action
  traversals.

* A regression test system for the classes under Coin/src/base.

* Profiling and optimalization of the base classes. Should depend on a
  good regression test suite having been implemented first.
