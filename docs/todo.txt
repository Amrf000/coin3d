WHAT'S THIS?
============

This document contains a list of various deficiencies in Coin that are
not "large enough" to warrant them being listed as full projects in
the docs/projects.txt file, and probably not "small enough" to be
fixed within an hour or two.

See also the api-wish-list.txt file for other "mini" projects.


STUFF TO FIX IN COIN
====================

* Bounding box rendering, major performance optimization
  2001-11-23  Morten Eriksen  <mortene@sim.no>

  Bounding boxes are now always recalculated when used for
  rendering. See the relevant code in SoShape::shouldGLRender().

  A huge speed-up when rendering bboxes instead of geometry could be
  had if SoShape nodes kept a bounding box cache in the same manner as
  SoSeparator nodes.
