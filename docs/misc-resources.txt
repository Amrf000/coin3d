WHAT'S THIS?
============

A collection of useful/interesting links for Coin developers. It can, for 
instance, be resources needed when adding new features to Coin or links to 
techniques for optimizing Coin.

THE LINKS
=========

* UNC Collide Research Group
  2000-12-14 Peder Blekken <pederb@sim.no>
  http://www.cs.unc.edu/~geom/collide/index.shtml

  Contains discussions on several collision detection algorithms.

* Optimized Collision Detection
  2001-05-10 Peder Blekken <pederb@sim.no>
  http://www.codercorner.com/Opcode.htm

  Claims to be much faster than other implementations. Is free to use
  in any commercail or non-commercial program.

* nVIDIA GL_vertex_array_range and GL_NV_fence
  2000-12-14 Peder Blekken <pederb@sim.no>
  http://www.nvidia.com/Marketing/Developer/DevRel.nsf/pages/AEE3673F9B8DBC228825693B00619F9C

  nVIDIA extensions for optimized rendering without using display lists.
  Link has example program, source code and documentation.

* Interactive Order-Independent Transparency
  2001-05-18 Peder Blekken <pederb@sim.no>
  http://www.nvidia.com/Marketing/Developer/DevRel.nsf/bookmark/EEFAD0772D0514D288256A4D00662526

  Uses shadow mapping hardware and alpha test. Can be implemented in
  OpenGL using Nvidia extensions for GeForce3.

* GL2PS. A Postscript rendering library.
  2001-06-11 Peder Blekken <pederb@sim.no>

  http://www.geuz.org/gl2ps/

  A library for rendering high quality postscript from any OpenGL
  application. Released under LGPL.

* openNURBS
  2001-07-20 Marius Kintel <kintel@sim.no>

  http://www.opennurbs.com

  For higher quality ? NURBS rendering. Nice license:

   - Commercial use is encouraged  
   - The tools, support, and membership are free
   - There are no restrictions. Neither copyright nor copyleft restrictions 
     apply
   - No contribution of effort or technology is required from the members, 
     although it is encouraged

* Kahlua
  2001-08-02  Morten Eriksen  <mortene@sim.no>

  <URL:http://www.igd.fhg.de/CP/kahlua/>

  A Java wrapper for the Open Inventor library. Sadly not open source,
  so we can't port it to Coin unless the author changes the licensing
  terms. larsa@sim.no is currently investigating.

  Maintainer is no longer Arno Schaefer <schaefer@jobpilot.com>, but
  Volker Luckas <luckas@igd.fhg.de>.

* Java language binding
  2001-08-02  Morten Eriksen  <mortene@sim.no>

  Here's the tutorial starting point at Sun's Java pages for
  interfacing to alien code through the Java Native Interface:

  <URL:http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/native1.1/index.html>

* SoXt-like GLUT component

  http://www.stud.fee.vutbr.cz/~xpeciv00/OIV/SoGlut/

* In-depth explanation of OpenGL on MSWin platforms:

  <URL:http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/>, follow the link to
  "Graphics and multimedia", then "Open GL"

* A shareware VRML browser and general 3D viewer (DXF, RAW, OBJ,
  GLView), which we could take a look at to compare features with our
  soon-to-come (?) VRMLView replacement:

  http://home.snafu.de/hg/

* OpenGL Multipipe SDK

  http://www.sgi.com/software/multipipe/sdk/

  SDK for programming multipipe applications on SGI hardware. Free
  download.

* Recommended book for learning about threads programming:
  "Programming With Threads", Kleiman / Shah / Smaalders, ISBN
  0131723898

* Miscellaneous C++ libraries: <URL:http://www.boost.org>. If the
  licenses are liberal, we might be able to avoid re-inventing wheels
  for some of the libraries provided.

* List of API changes from SGI Inventor v2.0 to v2.1:

   <URL:http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asd/lhc++/OpenInventor/pro/porting/chapter2.html>.

  Contains lots of information about obsoleted features and field
  value limitations that we need to check that we heed.

* Information about the OpenGL ABI:

    http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/ARB/get_proc_address.txt
    http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/ABI/

  See also the GLAF project ("OpenGL Advanced Functionality"), which
  wraps extensions etc in a portable framework (available under an
  MIT-license):

     http://webs.ono.com/usr003/cesarblecua/

* An application partly covering the ideas behind our "gl-attack"
  suggested project: <URL:http://glean.sourceforge.net>.

* Troll Tech's Technical FAQ for Qt contains information about what we
  can _not_ do when we want to keep ABI compatibility in new releases:

    <URL:http://www.trolltech.com/developer/faqs/technical.html>

* Distributed Open Inventor:

        <URL:http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/vr/div/>

  Software and Technology (VRST'99), pp. 74-81, 1999.
