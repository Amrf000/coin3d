WHAT'S THIS?
============

A collection of useful/interesting links for Coin developers. It can, for 
instance, be resources needed when adding new features to Coin or links to 
techniques for optimizing Coin.

THE LINKS
=========

* UNC Collide Research Group
  2000-12-14 Peder Blekken <pederb@sim.no>
  http://www.cs.unc.edu/~geom/collide/index.shtml

  Contains discussions on several collision detection algorithms.

* Optimized Collision Detection
  2001-05-10 Peder Blekken <pederb@sim.no>
  http://www.codercorner.com/Opcode.htm

  Claims to be much faster than other implementations. Is free to use
  in any commercail or non-commercial program.

* nVIDIA GL_vertex_array_range and GL_NV_fence
  2000-12-14 Peder Blekken <pederb@sim.no>
  http://www.nvidia.com/Marketing/Developer/DevRel.nsf/pages/AEE3673F9B8DBC228825693B00619F9C

  nVIDIA extensions for optimized rendering without using display lists.
  Link has example program, source code and documentation.

* Interactive Order-Independent Transparency
  2001-05-18 Peder Blekken <pederb@sim.no>
  http://www.nvidia.com/Marketing/Developer/DevRel.nsf/bookmark/EEFAD0772D0514D288256A4D00662526

  Uses shadow mapping hardware and alpha test. Can be implemented in
  OpenGL using Nvidia extensions for GeForce3.

* GL2PS. A Postscript rendering library.
  2001-06-11 Peder Blekken <pederb@sim.no>

  http://www.geuz.org/gl2ps/

  A library for rendering high quality postscript from any OpenGL
  application. Released under LGPL.

* openNURBS
  2001-07-20 Marius Kintel <kintel@sim.no>

  http://www.opennurbs.com

  For higher quality ? NURBS rendering. Nice license:

   - Commercial use is encouraged  
   - The tools, support, and membership are free
   - There are no restrictions. Neither copyright nor copyleft restrictions 
     apply
   - No contribution of effort or technology is required from the members, 
     although it is encouraged

* Kahlua
  2001-08-02 Morten Eriksen <mortene@sim.no>

  <URL:http://www.igd.fhg.de/CP/kahlua/>

  A Java wrapper for the Open Inventor library. Sadly not open source,
  so we can't port it to Coin unless the author changes the licensing
  terms. larsa@sim.no is currently investigating.
