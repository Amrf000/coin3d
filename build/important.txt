                   IMPORTANT!

To use the Coin SDK you have to set some environment
variables. Add the following to your AUTOEXEC.BAT:

   SET INCLUDE = C:\<INSTALLDIR>\include;%INCLUDE%
   SET LIB = C:\<INSTALLDIR>\lib;%LIB%

If you use Windows NT, you'll have to set the above
variables in your system user variables.
