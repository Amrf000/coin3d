Description: 3D graphics library compatible with Open Inventor
 Coin is a retain-mode 3D graphics library, based on OpenGL.
 It implements the Open Inventor 2.1 API.  If you already have a development
 setup for SGI Open Inventor or TGS Open Inventor on your computer, setting
 up Coin from source is probably the best idea so you can avoid conflicts
 caused by including the wrong header files.
