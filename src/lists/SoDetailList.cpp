  \brief The SoDetailList class is a container for pointers to SoDetail objects.
  \ingroup details
*/

// SoDetailList was moved from being a subclass of SbPList to being a
// subclass of SbList. This removed the need to do lots of ugly casts
// in overloaded methods, with the subsequent removal of all code in
// this file. 20000228 mortene.

/*!
  \fn SoDetailList::SoDetailList(void)

  Default constructor.
*/

/*!
  \fn SoDetailList::SoDetailList(const int sizehint)

  This constructor initializes the internal allocated size for the
  list to \a sizehint. Note that the list will still initially contain
  zero items.

  \sa SbList::SbList(const int sizehint)
*/

/*!
  \fn SoDetailList::SoDetailList(const SoDetailList & l)

  Copy constructor.

  \sa SbList::SbList(const SbList<Type> & l)
*/

/*!
  \fn void SoDetailList::set(const int index, SoDetail * item)

  This method sets the element at \a index to \a item. Does the same
  thing as SbList::operator[](). This method is only present for
  compatibility with the original Inventor API.
