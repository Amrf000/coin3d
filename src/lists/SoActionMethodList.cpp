  \class SoActionMethodList SoActionMethodList.h Inventor/lists/SoActionMethodList.h
  \brief The SoActionMethodList class contains function pointers for action methods.
  \ingroup actions

  An SoActionMethodList contains one function pointer per node
  type. Each action contains an SoActioMethodList to know which
  functions to call during scene graph traversal.
