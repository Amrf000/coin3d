  \class SoTypeList SoTypeList.h Inventor/lists/SoTypeList.h
  \brief The SoTypeList class is a container class for arrays of SoType objects.
  \ingroup general
*/

// SoTypeList was moved from being a subclass of SbPList to being a
// subclass of SbList. This removed the need to do lots of ugly casts
// in overloaded methods, with the subsequent removal of all code in
// this file. 19991025 mortene.

/*!
  \fn SoTypeList::SoTypeList(void)

  Default constructor.
*/

/*!
  \fn SoTypeList::SoTypeList(const int sizehint)

  This constructor initializes the internal allocated size for the
  list to \a sizehint. Note that the list will still initially contain
  zero items.

  \sa SbList::SbList(const int sizehint)
*/

/*!
  \fn SoTypeList::SoTypeList(const SoTypeList & l)

  Copy constructor.

  \sa SbList::SbList(const SbList<Type> & l)
*/

/*!
  \fn void SoTypeList::set(const int index, const SoType item)

  This method sets the element at \a index to \a item. Does the same
  thing as SbList::operator[](). This method is only present for
  compatibility with the original Inventor API.
