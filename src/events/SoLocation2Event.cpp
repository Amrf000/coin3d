  \class SoLocation2Event SoLocation2Event.h Inventor/events/SoLocation2Event.h
  \brief The SoLocation2Event class contains information about 2D movement
  events.
  \ingroup events

  Location2 events are generated by devices capable of 2D, e.g. pointer
  devices -- typically computer mice. Instances of this class contains
  information about the position of the pointer on the render area.

  SoLocation2Event does not contain any new information versus its
  superclass, its sole purpose is to make it possible to specify the
  type of the event for event object receivers in the scene graph.
