TODO:
=====

(format is: "* [author:conceived-date] item", listed in no particular order)

*** RENDERING ITEMS ***

* [mortene:1999????] support the SoRenderList and SoOctTreeOrdering
  stuff. Should at least provide a dummy implementation.

*** BUILD ITEMS ***

* [mortene:19991218] set up a "make test" target which can do
  regression testing. Take a look at the functionality offered by
  DejaGnu to see if it can be useful for our purposes.

* [pederb:19991217] demand at least version 2.8 when trying to compile
  with GCC (g++).

* [mortene:19990912] get rid of Inventor/system/inttypes.h. Check to
  see if we can use the AC_COMPILE_CHECK_SIZEOF macro from the
  autoconf macro archive to find and define types for 8/16/32/64 bits.
  Update: a related item is part of the OpenSSH TODO list as of
  release 1.2.2, and there's some code in configure.in.
  [larsa:20001201] AC_COMPUTE_INT is a run-time test, so if this is
  used, cross-compilation can't be done securely.

* [larsa:20001201] complete implementation of Borland Builder C++
  command line compiler wrapper script.  ilink32, DLL creation,
  dependency tracking...

* [larsa:20001201] add --with-vc++ / --with-borland configure flags
  for the case where both compiler suites are installed.

* [larsa:20001201] move auxiliary scripts to cfg/, use AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR(cfg)
  in configure.in, ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I cfg/m4 in toplevel Makefile.am, and
  add -I cfg/m4 to aclocal invocation in bootstrap.

*** GENERIC ITEMS ***

* [mortene:19991124] write documentation for the tools (ivcat,
  ivhierarchy, ...)

* [kintel:19990928] test and fix problems with running on 64-bit
  platforms.

* [mortene:1999????] Use float-versions of math-functions on platforms
  where they are supported (i.e. fcos(), fsqrt() etc instead of cos(),
  sqrt(), ..).

* [mortene:19990930] SbString.h is incompatible with the std::string
  STL definition? Look into this to see if it can be solved. (Reported
  by Jason Fritz on coin-devsupport.)

*** REPOSITORY ITEMS ****

* [larsa:20001201] remove info.cvs which (has no meaning on the public
  CVS server)

* [larsa:20001201] remove docs/whitepapers/ and do general update of docs
  under docs/

* [larsa:20001201] begin a new ChangeLog.  Will v1.0 coincide (pun not
  originally intended, but left as is and emphasized with this comment when
  it was discovered) with new years and the Coin competition deadline?
